## Java Champion

### What is a Java Champion?

According to [oracle](https://community.oracle.com/community/groundbreakers/java/java-champions), Java Champions are:

_an exclusive group of passionate Java technology and community leaders who are community-nominated and selected under a project sponsored by Oracle.
Java Champions get the opportunity to provide feedback, ideas, and direction that will help Oracle grow the Java Platform.
This interchange may be in the form of technical discussions and/or community-building activities with Oracleâ€™s Java Development and Developer Program teams._**
