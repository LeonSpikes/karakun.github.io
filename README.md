## Build instructions

In order to start `start.sh`  you have to install [_jekyll_](https://jekyllrb.com) (see instructions online).

If you want to install [_jekyll_](https://jekyllrb.com) on macOS,
you need to execute these commands in your terminal:

$ brew install ruby
$ gem install bundler jekyll

Then you can use `start.sh` to start a server for local inspection (preview) of your markdown.
